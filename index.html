            </header>
            <p>
                The Flexible Layout (flexible box) model began development
                sometime before 2008, with the aim of being able to quickly and 
                easily organize responsive elements on a webpage. Flexbox rolled
                fully in 2009, and has seen numerous revision in the fifteen years
                since it's introduction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Flexbox has a one-dimensional layout whereby users can organize
                their elements along a row or a column axis. Also included in the
                flex layout is the ability for the container to alter it's items'
                width and height. A flex container automatically expands items
                within it to fill available free space, or shrinks them to prevent
                oveflow.
            </p>
            <p>
                The flexbox layout is most apt for components of an application, 
                as well as smaller-scale layouts. For larger projects or whole-site
                layouts, we recommend reading into CSS

            <p>
                Before you begin delving into learning the basics of the Flexbox
                module, you should have a functional understanding of basic HTML
                and the other forms of positioning elements such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The CSS loat property and it's attribute</li>
                <li>Centering elements by using the CSS margin property</li>
                <li>Positioning text with the CSS text-align property</li>
            </ul>
