                    The Flexible Layout (flexible box) model began development
                    sometime before 2008, with the aim of being able to quickly and
                    easily organize responsive elements on a webpage. Flexbox rolled
                    fully in 2009, and has seen numerous revision in the fifteen years
                    since it's introduction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flexbox has a one-dimensional layout whereby users can organize
                    their elements along a row or a column axis. Also included in the
                    flex layout is the ability for the container to alter it's items'
                    width and height. A flex container automatically expands items
                    within it to fill available free space, or shrinks them to prevent
                    oveflow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The flexbox layout is most apt for components of an application,
                    as well as smaller-scale layouts. For larger projects or whole-site
                    layouts, we recommend reading into CSS

                DISPLAY ATTRIBUTES
            </header>
            <article class="section-article">
                <p>
                    CSS flexbox is only one of several attributes for the display
                    property. Some display properties set the behavor of the element
                    itself in the layout, and others (including flexbox) change how the
                    children of an element are positioned.
                    The display attributes that change the element's behavior itself are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The block attribute, which generates the element on a block
                        level, creating line breaks before and after the element
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The inline attribute, which doesn't generate breaks, and treats
                        the element as if it should be one the same line (provided
                        there is space)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        And, confusingly, the inline-block attribute. Inline-block
                        does not generate line-breaks before and after the element,
                        but lets you set a width and height for the element, as well
                        as maintain respect for the elements defined margin and padding
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    When written as code, these attributes look like:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        display: block;<br>
                        <span class="comment">/* or */</span><br>
                        display: inline;<br>
                        <span class="comment">/* or */</span><br>
                        display: inline-block;
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The display attributes that alter the way it's children are laid out
                    are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The flex attribute
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The grid attribute
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    There is actually one more display attribute that is relevant here:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        display: inline-flex;
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    By default the flex container behaves as a block-level element. By
                    setting it to inline-flex, it makes the container behave as an inline
                    element. There are use-cases for this, so keep it in the back of your
                    mind while coding.

                <p>
                    When working with flexbox you need to keep in mind the two different
                    axes; the main axis and the cross axis. Which is which depends on which way
                    you've defined your flex area to run; either horizontally or vertically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Horizontal and vertical flow is defined respectively with the following
                    attributes:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        flex-direction: row;<br>
                        <span class="comment">/* or */</span><br>
                        flex-direction: column;
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    If the flex-direction property were assigned with the row attribute, the main
                    axis would run along the row, and the cross axis would run along the column.
                    And vice-versa for if the property were assigned the column attribute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When your flex-direction is set to row, content within organizes itself, by 
                    default, from left-to-right, with the first element on the left.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if you want to have your content organized in rows by start from 
                    right-to-left, with your first item on the right side (Or a column starting
                    from bottom-to-top, with the first element on the bottom?) This is easily
                    accomplished in the flex axis:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        flex-direction: row-reverse;<br>
                        <span class="comment">/* or */</span><br>
                        flex-direction: column;
                    </code>
                </div>

                <p>
                    As with most CSS properties, some of it's initial values have a default
                    value unless explicitly set. These include (but are not limited to):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Flex-direction: set to default as 'row.'</li>
                    <li>The items start along the edge of the main axis.</li>
                    <li>
                        The items do not stretch (using flex-grow) but can shrink (flex-shrink)
                        along the main axis.
                    </li>
                    <li>The items will stretch to fit the size of the cross axis.</li>
                    <li> The flex-basis property is set to auto.</li>  
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The flex property is a property that sets how a flex item, that
                    is, the child of an element with an property of display flex. Flex is shorthand
                    for three properties:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>flex-grow</li>
                    <li>flex-shrink</li>
                    <li>flex-basis</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    When the flex-container's main size is larger than the combined main sizes of 
                    the flex items, the extra space is distributed among the flex items.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flex-grow sets the grow factor for a flex-item in the remaining space along the 
                    main axis of the flex-container. If flex-grow for element "A" is set to 1, in
                    a flex-container that has two other elements "B" and "C", then A will take up twice
                    space as both B or C (assuming B and C's grow factor is set to 1).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flex-shrink sets the shrink factor for a flex-item in the remaining space along the
                    main-axis of the flex-container. Following the prior lettering system, if the
                    flex-shrink for element A is set to 1, it doesn't shrink it at all next to B and C
                    (provided their shrink-factor is set to 1 as well.) If the shrink factor of A is set
                    to 2, however, it shrinks to half the size, and B and C resize to be twice the size
                    of A, each.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flex-basis is used to set the size of the flex-item. If the width of an item 
                    is set to 200px, but based on available space, there is 300px that it can grow to,
                    the flex-container will set the width to 300px. If you want to explicitly prevent
                    shrink or grow, flex-basis ignores available space to grow in to, or unavailable 
                    space to shrink in to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As mentione earlier, the flex shorthand property can be used to define all three of
                    these properties at the same time:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>

                        <span class="comment">/* flex-grow | flex-shrink | flex-basis */</span>
                    </code>

                FLEX WRAP

            <article class="section-article">
                <p>
                    By default, a flex-container has their flex-wrap property set to nowrap. What does this
                    mean? When a flex-container's width is exceeded by the number of flex-items, with no room
                    left to shrink them further, the flex-items will overflow outside of the container.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If, however, we have the flex-wrap set to wrap, the container pushes the overflowing items
                    onto either a new row or column. The container will continue to expand to account for 
                    new rows, potentially causing an overflow itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, the flex-wrap property can also be set to row-reverse. This will cause what would
                    have been the last row to come first, and the first row to come last. This does not 
                    rearrange the order within each row/column, however.
